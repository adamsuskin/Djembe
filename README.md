Play some beats on some authentic African drums!

## Overview

This is a work-in-progress app for my music class MUSI2960, known as "African Drumming." Our job is to use any creative talent to make something special that is relevant to African drumming, so I figured an app where you could drum on some different kinds of drums would be a great way to demonstrate our creativity.

## Team & Project

I (Adam Suskin) am in charge of making the app. Aakash Patel has taken some pictures and created designs that will be used in the app. Then, Blake Kaplan and Josh Kalter are going to make a video about people on the street using the app (after it is published).
